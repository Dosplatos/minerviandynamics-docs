title: Generating Isk
description: A guide to getting ISK in EVE
---

There is no truly safe form of generating ISK in New Eden. When you leave 
station, you are at risk even in the highest of high 1.0 High Sec space. 

The <span class="keyword">Career Expert (CE)</span> for each section is a leader in our corporation who is 
highly experienced with their related activies, and generally always online to 
answer questions -- In-game or on Discord.

## Industrialist
<br />
<span class="keyword">Lucian Loxform</span>
<br />

Want to be self-funded and make all your own stuff while making a tidy profit? 
Become an Industrialist!

Industry takes the raw materials that others mine or buy and processes it into 
a finished product using blueprints. Much like in the Marketing stream, your 
goods can be sold at a profit. 

This can provide a steady stream of income even at the lower levels and ramps 
up in complexity rather quickly. The higher the levels that you go the more 
skills are required and can be quite time consuming, but ultimately worth it as 
you can produce anything eventually that exists in the game from ammo to space 
stations. 

### Markets
<br />
<span class="keyword">MoonChild 4472</span>
<br />

Ever wanted to buy and sell goods like a stockbroker and then haul them into 
the vast regions of space? Well then, it's time for you to play the Market! 

Watching prices and buying/selling anything in the game when and where the 
market is hot is a viable option. The risk is low but the only time in space 
will be spent in transport, traveling from hub to hub. Check out our [market 
overview](/career-overview/markets) for more details.

**Note:** _Although your routes can avoid LowSec and NullSec space entirely, just 
know that HiSec ganking does occur._


### Mining: 
<br />
<span class="keyword">Lucian Loxform</span>
<br />
Do you yearn for the reaches of space where riches lie or to gather frigid Ice 
in the cold of space or scoop precious and valuable Gas into your cargo hold? 
Then you should be a Miner! 

This activity involves collecting the basic components for industry in game and 
selling them in bulk. It is much slower game play and is often referred to as 
"grinding". A pilot needs to fit their ship for the type of material to be 
mined and search for asteroids, gas clouds, glacial masses and even mine moons 
at later skill levels. 

Risk is guaranteed as NPC rats will show up to attack the player. These NPCs 
are often the weakest NPC combat presence in any system.

For more information, check out [Koz’s Spacer Guide to Minin’](/career-overview/mining).


## Explorer
<br />
<span class="keyword">Doctor WilyCoyote</span>
<br />
Do you enjoy discovering hidden relics and exploring unknown space? You should 
be an Explorer! 

One thing to note is that although there is an NPC element in Data/Relic 
Scanning that can be serious, Data sites generally do not have a lot of NPCS. 
Do not scan Ghost and Covert Sites as a new player. The real danger there lies 
in the hacking minigame. ships fit for this will have good buffs for the 
activity, but the equipment takes up precious mid-slots. 

Sites can reward BPCs, filaments and even implants that can fetch a good price 
in the markets. 

For more Information, check out [exploration](/career-overview/exploration).

### Wormholes: 
<br />
<span class="keyword">Doctor WilyCoyote</span>
<br />
Is regular K-Space too safe with its gate travel and CONCORD security. Do you 
want to explore a completely unsecured “Wild West '' space finding shortcuts 
between vast parts of New Eden whilst also potentially making a fortune? Then 
become a Wormholer! 

Wormholes can lead to many different places in New Eden, from HiSec to NullSec 
space or even to an off the map system that is not part of the jump gate 
network. 

NPCs in these systems are tougher than some NullSec NPC’s so you must be very 
careful when completing combat sites. 

Adventurous groups of pilots even set up stations in the wormhole systems and 
live there. Wormholes do close over time or if enough mass is passed through 
them, and this fact can make wormholes unpredictable as you can find yourself 
cut off and a long way from home, but there will always be a way out…  if you 
can find it. 

Mining and sites of all varieties can be found in wormholes but are usually of 
high quality and sell for quite a bit of ISK!

For more information, check out the 
[wormhole](/career-overview/exploration#wormholes) section of 
[exploration](/career-overview/exploration).

### Missions 
<br />
Missions CE: <span class="keyword">TBA</span>
<br />
Do you enjoy following orders or helping your fellow man in noble quests 
scattered across the stars? Then you should… well run missions. 

Missions can be accepted and completed through agents set up in the NPC 
stations across New Eden. Pilots can find these agents and their locations in 
the "The Agency '' quick button defaulted on the upper left of the screen.

The type of mission and your standings with the agent's employers will 
determine the difficulty. Some low level missions do not involve NPC presence 
at all and may be as simple as fetch quests. 

For More Information, check out [Missions](/career-overview/missions).

### Ratting (Bounties)
<br />
Ratting/Bounties CE: <span class="keyword">TBA</span>
<br />
Did you ever want to hunt pirates? Clean up the scum of New Eden or just 
generally want to shoot stuff in space? You should be a Soldier of Fortune!

This involves hunting the NPCs (or Rats) that inhabit the mining belts, combat 
sites, and anomalies. 

These NPCs can generate a nice amount of ISK through the bounties on their 
heads and are paid out automatically. 

As a bonus some good loot can be found in the cargo holds of the wrecks and 
salvage what's left to get a little more.

On top of getting paid you will have the chance to score rare drops and salvage 
that can be worth millions of ISK.

For more information, check out [Ratting](/career-overview/ratting).

### Abyssal Space: 
<br />
<span class="keyword">Lareld</span>
<br />
Do you feel lucky? Well do ya? Do you want an edge of your seat experience? 
Keep your wits about you traveling with us into the Abyss… 

Sounds dangerous right? It is. Probably the most dangerous beginner activity 
that can be done is _traveling into Abyssal Space._ However, it's _very_ 
rewarding. 

Filaments are used to access abyssal space. These are high risk combat sites. 
Once inside you cannot leave until all NPCs are dead, and they can be very hard 
if you’re not prepared or with a fleet (but that’s why you got us right?) 

There is a cordon around the area of conflict, a fence that will vaporize you 
if crossed for too long. There is also a time limit to get through all three 
areas or it will also kill you if you run out of time. 

You cannot warp out to repair. You cannot loot your wreck to mitigate loss. It 
is all or nothing. This is the Abyss… 

However, these sites are some of the best loot drops in the game. Being able to 
crush these challenges is a huge bragging right and can be viewed by some 
pilots as a progression milestone in your journey in the complex galaxy that is 
New Eden.

## Soldier of Fortune

### Faction Warfare:
<br />
<span class="keyword">Max R Zeal</span>
<br />
Do you have the skills to be an Ace pilot? Do you enjoy the cat and mouse games 
to evade your opponent and then turn the tables in a dogfight? Do you have a 
need, a need for speed? Enlist now! Join the war effort and be the difference 
between victory and defeat!  

Fighting for one of 4 major factions (Amarr, Caldari, Gallente and Minmitar) 
involves enlisting in their respective Militias via Faction Warfare. Your 
baseline standings with the faction must be at least neutral at 0.0 to enlist. 
Quests and missions through agents affiliated with your preferred faction (at 
ETC it is Gallente) can help to increase the base standing. 

You can fleet up or fly solo, although there is safety in numbers. In your 
factions’ contested systems (you’ll find the map for under Faction Warfare on 
the NeoComm) and then essentially play King of the Hill with a timer against 
other pilots and fleets. 

You receive loyalty points for your effort which you redeem at the nearest 
militia office listed for all kinds of goodies, such as blueprints and 
implants. A variety of items in the Loyalty Point store can be contacted to the 
Corp for a substantial gain via the Corp Buyback program listed in the 
Bulletin.

You now should have a basic understanding of the main activities that EVE has 
to offer, and some of the leadership in our corporation who you can connect 
with. There is a

[many websites](/reference/useful-websites/#resources), youtube videos and 
wiki's filled with all the myriad of ways that one can occupy themselves in the 
vastness of  New Eden. 

We all were where you are right now. If you have questions, just ask. Hit up
