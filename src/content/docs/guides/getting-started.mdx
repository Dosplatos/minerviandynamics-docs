# New Pilots

First off, here are some ~hot takes~ **hard truths** about playing EVE Online: 

1. You will die. **Repeatedly.**

    Every time you undock you are at risk of losing 
    your ship. This is intended to teach you to have the proper awareness and 
    pre-planning for the risks involved. Some of the earlier 
    <a href="https://www.ccpgames.com/" target="_blank">CCP</a> _(the studio 
    who develops EVE Online)_ engineers were 
    <a href="https://uo.com/" target="_blank">Ultima Online</a> veterans. EVE is a 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_game" target="_blank">sandbox</a> 
    MMORPG.

2. There are no shortcuts. **This game requires a lot of patience.**

    The latter part of that statement isn't exactly true. There are no _free_ 
    shortcuts. Being able to do the thing you want to do in the game **really 
    well** may take more time than you'd like. We recommend playing for a couple of 
    months or using an omega clone for a bit before investing in 
    too much plex or other stuff in CCP's <a href="https://secure.eveonline.com/" target="_blank">online store</a>.

3. **This game can be difficult.** It can seem even more difficult when you 
start running into more complex parts of the game.

    But, thankfully you have us for that.

### The Starting Point

We recommend that you first start with completing the <a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/AIR_Career_Program" target="_blank">AIR Career Program</a> 
before continuing on with this guide. Some may be harder than others, but if 
you've got a good idea of where you want to concentrate then continue on.

### <span class="hiddenTitles">The Stuff They Don’t Teach in Flight School</span>
#### The Stuff They Don’t Teach in Flight School:

- Don't fly something that you cannot afford to lose (sometimes known as the First Rule of EVE).
- Before engaging a ship or deciding to stay somewhere, ask yourself “Can I handle this at my skill level and the ship I’m in?” If you paused for an answer then you should probably not engage or leave the system to live and fight on somewhere else. 
- Always warp to 0m on a gate. DO NOT AUTOPILOT. Autopilot places you at 2500m from the gate which gives pilots and NPCs just enough time to kill you.
- Never attempt to rush your skills to achieve the next rank of ships, especially to achieve something like battleships. Small and medium-sized ships in EVE can make a huge impact.
- If you set the route to a system, the next stargate on the route will show up in yellow, so you can find it easily. 
- You can tell your route-finder to avoid particular systems if you want it to design routes avoiding particularly dangerous chokepoints such as Uedama.
- A good quest line to complete first off is the sisters of EVE ``Epic Arc" titled "The Blood Stained Stars. This quest chain is approx. 50 missions and may take a little time to complete.
- Play around with the "Neocom Menu". It is located at the top left of your hud. it looks like three horizontal lines or a stylized "E". This menu allows you to access all the different information and tools for use in the game. 
- Learn the Hotkeys for various ship and menu actions. They can be the difference between life and death in the game where split-second decisions happen often. 
- Ask your fellow Corp members questions. We all started where you are, we asked questions too. Now we can pass that knowledge on to you.


### What’s your Fly-Style?

In order to do most things in EVE, you at least need to be able to generate a 
little bit of ISK. EVE has a lot of options to do that -- So many that it can be 
overwhelming, and that leads a lot of pilots to quit. 

In an effort to make your choices easier, we've prepared detailed guides and 
informational resources through the context of membership in our corporation. 
These details will introduce you to some of our established team members and 
walk you through the fundamental aspects of each method/career tactic.

**Will we cover everything?**

No, that would be impossible, but we will cover the main activities most people 
can start out doing.
