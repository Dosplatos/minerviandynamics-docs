Come on in, pull up a stool, I won’t bite… hard. HA HA HA HA. 

Ok ya wanna know all about the best damn profession in New Eden? What? A 
Faction Warfare Pilot? NO, I’m talking Minin’ baby. Blastin’ rocks, making moon 
dust, huffin’ gas. Dats were the money is at. So plant your ass down and let me 
lay some of dat knowledge on ya. Now first things first. 

Minin’ is:

The lifeblood of the whole damn galaxy and how anything gets made in New Eden.
A mostly safe way (at least if ya stick to HiSec) to earn dat sweet sweet ISK.
Pays even better with better ships and especially in ya be gas and ice minin’ 

Minin’ AIN’T:

An activity you can run on autopilot or be doing while on the can in more 
dangerous parts of space such as LowSec and NullSec.
A high octane thrill ride but itll keep the iskies in ya pocket and won’t get 
ya killed, most of da time.

## Stuff you need to know up front:

Be able to fly the ol’ reliable Venture without crashing into the giant 
boulders floatin past ya windows. They taught you dat in flight school (the 
Career Missions) right? 

Know how to fit you ship out to run them lasers, do dads and whatyamacallits. 

### Startin’ out: 

Minin’ tis one of dem activities in New Eden dat don’t have dem flashy bells 
and whistles. It ain’t the most glamorous of the activities but it’d be the 
lifeblood of the whole damn universe. Raw materials are needed for justa about 
ever’thing dat ya can build. This also means dat your always gonna have some’un 
buyin whatcha got there in dat there hold, whether it be ore, ice or gas. 

Ya can mine the dem raw materials in one of tree ways: Blasting Rocks (Ore), 
Cutting Ice (Ice) and Huffin’ Gas (gas). 

### Blastin’ Rocks:

Ore is ever’where in New Eden. All dem asteroid belts you can see off in the 
distance, are chocka full of valuable stuff and there in near every damn system 
imaginable. Dat there ore you'll find in dem belts ill change depending on the 
security status of the system, The lower the Security status the more rare and 
valuable dat dem rocks gonna be. 

Now, Now, don’t go off all half cocked and try to mine NullSec Ore, come on 
back. Dat's some dangerous stuff out there.  

Pirates or “rats” as they be commonly called will show up in dem there belts 
when ya least expectin’ it to steal your hard earned stuff. Dem rats in Lowsec 
and Nullsec be some tough sunabitch so be careful out there. 

Ya can catch em with their pants down with a couple combat little drone buddies 
(ie.Hobgoblins), poppin out and blastin’ dem to pieces, well in HiSec at least. 

If you're smart you might even have a salvage little buddy in there too, to get 
some value out of dem rats carcasses. Probably only worth they’ve ever had 
their whole damn miserable lives.  

### Cutting Ice: 

Big ol’ chucks of Ice floating out there in space can be valuable too. Mostly 
used for makin tings like heavy water and the like. 

Ting about ice though is dat it be big, easy taking 1000m3 in ya hold. If you 
got some kind soul compression’ it for you, it helps a lot. 

Damn rats infest dem there icebergs in space as well,  make sure your packin 
with some tougher little drone buddies to make ‘em as cold as dat there ice 
around dem. 

Also you’ll need to have dat there special knowledge (skills) on how to use ice 
harvester lasers otherwise you ain’t gonna be able to cut nothin’.

### Huffin’ Gas: 

Tis here is where da real money be, however they can be tricky. Hisec has some 
of dem sites but they almost always be gone by the time yall get there to mine 
dem. LowSec and NullSec sites how’ever have to be prob’d and scanned down to 
get at dem there precious vapours. 
 
Speakin of dem vapours, you want to watch out for dem there rats again as they 
can pack a punch and turn you into vapours. Make sure to pop out some even 
tougher combat little drone buddies to show em who’s the boss of this here 
cloud.

You’ll also need dat there special knowledge again (skills) to operate dem gas 
scoops, so make sure you got dat before you start lookin’

## Fittin’ out Your Ship:
Now when your startin’ out in your minin’ enterprise you want to start with the 
ol’ reliable Venture. This sweet little number has a stable warp core dat makes 
it harder for dem real baddies (Real players) to hold you down fore you warp on 
out of there. 

The fittin’ should look like the followin’: 

<img src={venture.src} alt="Venture T1 Mining Fitting" style="border-radius: 5px;" />

This here is a low cost fit dat will get you start’d and on your way. You’ll 
want to get your hands on some manuals (skilling into the ships)  for dem 
fancier ORE ships such as the Retriever,  Covetor or Hulk when you can but this 
will do to make you some good ISK in the meantime. 

Watch out for dem Ice and Gas manuals(Skill books) as well but be careful, dat 
there gas harvestin’ one can cost a pretty penny, 30 mil ISK if I do recall. 
I’d get dat one there at Jita if ya can. 

## Alpha vs. Omega Clones

Now those of you who are in dem alpha clone bodies are kinda limited but not 
handicapped in your choices of mining. You can only reeeally use dat ol’ 
reliable Venture. With better mods though she can mine with the best but her 
hold, she real small compared to the big boys. 

The fancier Omega clones they can get all kinds of lovely ships and do some 
real heavy mining with everythin’ from Ice Harvesters to Strip Miners. 


Here are a few thoughts on dem bigger girls dat are available on the market:

- The <span class="specialHighlight">Procurer</span> and the 
<span class="specialHighlight">Skiff</span> -- These two ladies are good for a 
variety of minin’ all by your lonesome. This can be in LowSec, NullSec or even 
Wormhole space if you feeling especially adventurous… or suicidal. They mine 
slower than their cousins but dey got a bigger bay for miner little drone 
buddies or some combat little drone buddies for popin those sneaky rat bastards.
- The <span class="specialHighlight">Covetor</span> and the 
<span class="specialHighlight">Hulk</span> -- Are also good for minin’ solo but 
they have a smaller hold than their beefier cousins. Good for those in and out 
runs in the more dangerous corners of New Eden. 
- <span class="specialHighlight">Retriever</span> and 
<span class="specialHighlight">Mackinaw</span> -- These two are the Big 
Bertha’s of the minin’ world. They mine decent but itll take ya fo’ever to fill 
though. 
- <span class="specialHighlight">Endurance</span> -- For dat there sneaky Ice 
minin’
- <span class="specialHighlight">Prospect</span> -- For dat there sneaky Gas 
huffer

## Partin’ Thoughts: 
Alright, I’m thinkin’ dat covers the basics but few more assort’d tips I can 
lay on ya:

Keep urself aligned to something when minin’ in LowSec or Null Sec space. Dat 
way if the real baddies show up you can bug out of there before they can web ya 
or worse scram your ass. 

Always be using your D-Scan while mining in LowSec or NullSec space, you can 
usually see dem bastards trying to sneak up on ya, with thier combat probes or 
dem just showin’ up on your radar like we can’t see em. Well dat is unless they 
be cloaked, then you really can’t see em….

Remember, be downright rude not to tip your Porpoise or Orca pilots. Running 
dem mammoth industrial ships ain’t cheap. Customary is about 10% off what your 
hold estimates for you on the read out. 

Make sure to check out the Agency board for a heads up on ore anomalies and if 
your lookin’ for a special kind of ore for a project ya been tinkering with. If 
you look in the Ore anomalies tab under Resource Harvesting and filter for High 
Sec, dem 0.5 rated systems got some sweet Low-Sec ore in High Sec space.

Better run on now quick and get to dem before the big boys get there first and 
suck it dry.

Remember Fly Safe now ya here
