# Wormholes

So you want to try your hand at Wormholes. Looming holes of possible death and 
untold riches beckoning you from beyond? Or if you just want to try it out, 
well you're in the right place.

Wormholes are : 

- Complete Systems in an unknown pocket of space
- They can be dead ends, having only one entrance and exit orâ€¦
    - A network of wormholes that act like jump gates 
- Lucrative mining, Ratting, Relic/Data and salvage opportunities

Wormholes are not: 

- Permanent 
- Sovereign space or monitored by Concord
- Simple -- They can be easy if done right but punishing if not

Some reasons for diving into Wormholes: 

- They are equally as lucrative than mining in Null Sec and less populated
- Plentiful content to explore and discover
- They are strange undiscovered spaces in the vastness of New Eden

## Foundational Knowledge on Startup:
- How to use your Directional Scanner (D Scan) this is by far the most 
important tool you have.
- How to use Scanner probes and basic scanning techniques
- How to bookmark, make a safety, and make an escape route
- How and what data sites/relic/combat sites you can handle
- How to practice safe and plentiful mining 

### Terminology:

Some of the terminology below isn't ubiquitous to EVE (namely, Sig, EXIT, and 
ENTRANCE), but are terms we use when talking about Jspace.

- Known Space (or K-Space) -- Anything with a name or a jump gate
- Wormhole/WH (or J-Space) -- Any system that you can only reach through a wormhole.
- ENTRANCE -- Wormhole that is found in a system from Reblier to Scolluser.
- EXIT -- Wormhole outside of the previously mentioned system chain that leads 
to a connection INSIDE that system chain..
- Sig -- Cosmic anomaly

_Note: EXITs and ENTRANCEs are sometimes called CONNECTS._


## Identification:

### System Type
The first sentence talks about the type of the wormhole.

Using the Show Info option on the WH will list one of the following:

- This wormhole seems to lead into `{important part}` parts of space ðŸ‘‡

| Text | Meaning |
|-|-|
| Unknown | C1/C2/C3 |
| Dangerous Unknown | C4/C5 |
| Deadly Unknown | C6 |
| High Security | HiSec |
| Low Security | LowSec |
| Null Secuirty | NullSec |
| Triglavian Space | Pochven |

**Note:** _C1 through C3 are pretty manageable with skills up to and including 
battlecruiser needed for a C2 or C3. C4 and C5 are scary and shouldn't be 
attempted by ANY alpha account or really any of us at the moment. C6..... 
those are for ratting with dreadnoughts. Seriously._

### Life
Indicated next is how much time the wormhole has before it collapses. 

- This wormhole has **not yet begun** its natural cycle of decay and should last at 
least another day
- This wormhole is **beginning to decay**, and probably won't last another day
- This wormhole is **reaching the end** of its natural lifetime


| Text | Meaning |
|-|-|
| Not yet begun | More than 24 hours |
| Beginning to decay | Between 4 and 24 hours |
| Teaching the end | Less than 4 hours |


**Note:** _When the wormhole is just on the verge of collapse, where it says 
**"dissipating into the ether"** the wormhole is at its end of life and has ~15 
minutes or less. It is therefore not recommended to traverse an end-of-life 
wormhole without some alternative method of returning back home._

### Mass

Next up is how much mass can pass through the wormhole before it collapses. 
This will only come into play if you are jumping something bigger than a 
cruiser

- This wormhole has not yet had its stability significantly disrupted by ships 
passing through it
- This wormhole has had its stability reduced by ships passing through it, but 
not to a critical degree yet
- This wormhole has had its stability critically disrupted by the mass of 
numerous ships passing through and is on the verge of collapse

| Text | Meaning |
|-|-|
| Not yet | Over 50% |
| Not in critical degree | Between 10 - 50% |
| Stability critically disrupted | Less than 10% |

### Size

Last is the size of the ship that can pass through the wormhole.

| Text | Meaning |
|-|-|
| Very large ships | All except Titans and Supercarriers |
| Larger ships | Up to Battleships and Orcas |
| Up to medium size ships | Up to Unplated Nestors and Battlecruisers |
| Only the smallest ships | Up to Spec HICs, Destroyers and Frigates |

## Scanning And Bookmarking:  

When saving the location of a wormhole, whether it is inside another wormhole 
or an entrance or exit, right click on the wormhole in the OVERVIEW. 

This is important because this saves the exact location and will make jumping 
to 0m on the wormhole works the same as jumping to 0m on a jump gate. 

**Note:** _Saving the location in the scanner probe window does not always make this 
the case._

### Naming Convention:

The format below is a suggestion -- not a rule -- but will help your fellow corp 
members if followed:

```
<Class of wormhole> <Frigate, if it will only allow frigates> <numerical designation.>
```

An example of a C3 wormhole that allows larger ships was found in the 
Masalle system: 

```
C3 1
```

If it is the first WH scanned down then designate it 1 The second one would be 
designated 2 and so forth. An example of a second WH, scanned that only allowed 
frigates and was a C4 would be labeled as: 

```
C4 Frigate 2
```

When saving a bookmark for wormholes, save in the shared folder 'WH near Masalle' 
This will save everyone time and make it available to everyone. 

### Empty Bookmarked WH Sites:

If you jump to a bookmark in known space that leads to nothing then please 
delete it from the folder. However, if you find an empty bookmark INSIDE a WH, 
change the name to SAFETY. 

This is now only scannable by combat probes, meaning while you are at this 
location you can only be scanned down and targeted by Combat probes. Core 
probes are no longer an immediate threat.

Now that the entrance is saved, jump in the wormhole. The absolute most 
important part of wormhole diving is knowing the way back out. So as soon as 
you jump through the wormhole, look in your overview for the wormhole you just 
came through and save it as: 

```
EXIT to Masalle
```

This prevents you from getting trapped or having to guess which wormhole leads 
back the way you came. If you jump away before doing this you will have to scan 
it back down and it's a guessing game as to which wormhole is the exit.

### Bookmarking Non-WH while in WH Space:

After you have scanned down any type of sig that is NOT a wormhole, click in 
the **PROBE SCANNER** window and click save location. 

An example of this would be a Combat Site. Saving the location brings up the 
usual dialogue box with one big difference. It has the letter/number 
designation of the site and the name of the site already in the typing field. 

Delete the letter/number designation and replace it with the type of site, in 
this example COMBAT. Leaving the full name of the site means you or whoever 
comes after you can look up on eve university exactly what is in that site.

An example of what would be in the text box for a combat site :

Original writing:
`TLZ-864 Serpentis Phi-Outpost`

Saved as:
`COMBAT Serpentis Phi-Outpost`

If it was a Relic, Data or Gas site then that would be in place of COMBAT

**Note:** _DO NOT JUMP to a site and save from there. There are a few sites 
that can and will kill you before you can realign and jump out. Or you might 
start the spawn timer prematurely._

### Bookmarking WH inside WH Space:

The same naming convention is used while bookmarking WH within wormhole space 
as outside. 

Bookmark using the OVERVIEW panel and make sure that when jumping to the new WH 
that you remain 100km out. An example of naming the first WH that leads to 
LowSec space would be as follows. 

```
LoSec 1
```

Note: ALWAYS mark your EXIT upon transversal of a wormhole. This way it is 
easily identifiable and provides a quick exit. 

OPTIONALLY you can label the WH more specifically if you jump through, 
identifying the system and then jump back.You would then change the bookmark 
back in WH Space upon your return to:

```
Losec Reblier 1
```

## Activities in WH Space:
The activities that can be launched from WH are more extensive than what is 
listed here but for the basics, it comes down to two things: Mining and Scanning 
Sites.

### Mining: 
Mining in WH space can be very lucrative as previously mentioned a few examples 
of 	this are as follows:

- High Sec venture mining- full hold = ~ 1 mil ISK.
- Low Sec venture mining - full hold = ~ 3 mil ISK 
- Gas Mining - full hold = ~20-35 mil ISK or more. 
    - Note: Higher end Gas can be sold for even more, but I have not personally 
    been able to get to it as of yet. All ores that can be found in Low Sec or 
    Null Sec space(but not Abyssal) can be found in WH space.

### Scanning Sites:
In a C1-C3 Combat Sites can be scanned down and will produce up to 3 waves of 
5-8 mobs. This can result in loot that sells around 400k for each kill. 

Data and Relic sites are also profitable but random. A good analog is loot 
boxes. These can contain anything from 1 ISK to 100 mil worth of items.

Salvage is a profitable stream for this activity as well. This can be an 
additional 10% of your killâ€™s loot.  

## Final Tips:

If you are jumping from our chain and find a high-sec exit that is closest to a 
trade hub, immediately tell Corp chat. This can save a lot of time. WHâ€™s have 
had exits that have led to Perimeter, turning a 15 jump route to a 4 jump 
route. 

As always you can message Doctor WilyCoyote with any questions as he is our 
<span class="keyword">Career Expert</span> and would be happy to help in game. 
Please express interest to Doc or the corp if this is a direction you would 
like to try.
