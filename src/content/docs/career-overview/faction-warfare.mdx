Faction warfare (FW) is a large subset of PVP gameplay in EVE. The way it works 
is that players join a militia of one of the four major factions and battle 
players of an opposing faction for control of star systems. Gallente war 
against the Caldari, and Minmitar war against Amarr. 

## Faction Warfare Space
[Faction warfare](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Faction_warfare) space is the 
region of New Eden where an opposing faction can capture systems. Most of the 
systems in EVE aren’t in faction warfare space (e.g. Dodixie and Jita aren’t in 
FW space) and all of faction warfare space is LOW SEC (security rating of 
0.0-0.4).

### Militia 
The militia of a given faction is an NPC corporation that you can join at most 
faction-owned stations. You can be in a faction’s militia and a player-owned 
corporation at the same time.

Each faction’s militia has the following respective names:
- **Amarr**: 24th Imperial Crusade
- **Caldari**: State Protectorate
- **Gallente**: Federal Defense Union
- **Minmatar**: Tribal Liberation Force

When you’re in a militia, others in your militia will appear as purple on your 
overview and will have the following icon next to them in chat: . They’re 
generally referred to as “friendlies” or “purples” or “blueberries”.

Opposing militia members will have this icon in chat and will be flashing: and 
they’re usually referred to as “squids”, “reds”, or just “hostiles”. You can 
shoot opposing militia members anywhere and you will not be attacked by either 
gate guns or CONCORD. However, that works both ways. An opposing militia member 
can fire on you and CONCORD will NOT come to your rescue and gate guns will 
NOT fire on them.

## Participating in Faction Warfare
Here are a few steps to participate in faction warfare:


1. Check your standing: Before you can enlist in faction warfare, you need to 
ensure your standing with the faction you wish to join is not too low. If your 
standing is too low, you may need to improve it by running missions or other 
activities for that faction. Your standing can be checked in your character 
sheet.

2. Enlist: To join faction warfare, find a faction warfare agent in one of the 
faction's stations. These agents are often located in the same station where 
you can find the militia corporation's office. Speak to the agent and choose to 
enlist. This will officially make you a member of your faction's militia. We 
fly Gallente, so you’ll want to pick a Gallente station in Gallente space. 
You can’t enlist with Gallente in Jita.

3. Join a fleet: Faction warfare is often a group activity, so it's a good idea 
to join a fleet. Fleets provide safety in numbers and can be more effective 
when capturing or defending systems. Here are some options for joining a fleet:
    - Check corp FW fleet times: If you are a member of a player-owned 
    corporation (player corp), check with your corp mates to see if they have 
    scheduled faction warfare fleet operations. This is a great way to 
    participate with people you already know.
    - Look for standing militia fleets: In the militia chat channels, you can 
    often find announcements about standing fleet operations. These fleets are 
    usually open to all militia members and are an excellent way to get 
    involved quickly.

4. Rally with the fleet: Once you've chosen a fleet to join, make your way to 
the designated rally point, which is typically in a specific system or station. 
Coordinate with fleet members to ensure you're in the right place at the right 
time. At the time of posting this doc, we rally in Murethand.

5. Ship and Fleet Comp: Depending on your fleet's objectives, you'll need to 
choose an appropriate ship and fit. Fleet compositions vary widely, but 
generally, you should aim to complement your fleet's strategy. Be sure to 
communicate with your fleet commander or experienced fleet members to get 
guidance on ship types and fits that are currently favored. Once the corp 
decides on fleet comp, you’ll be asked to conform to a role in the fleet. 
Naturally, this can change from session to session or even during a session we 
may ask people to hop into another ship type. These are the most common ship 
roles that’ll appear in faction warfare, and there can be some overlap:
    - Bashers/Brawlers
    - Deal lots of DPS at close range
    - Meant to be very close in 
    - Tackle
    - Has the capability to webify enemy ships to dramatically reduce their speed, making it easier to hit
    - Has the capability to scram or disrupt an enemy ship’s warp drive, making it unable to escape
    - Sometimes overlaps with bash/brawl type ships
    - Snipers
    - Can reliably strike targets at long range (usually past 50 km)
    - In addition to turrets and missiles, snipers can fulfill their role with drones. Either combat drones that fly to their targets from a great distance or sentry drone that have long firing ranges
    - Logis
    - Provides repairs (heals shields, armor, and/or structure)
    - Provides boosts to your capacitor
    - Provides buffs to modules 
    - Tanks
    - Has a large pool of EHP (effective hit points) to endure many hits from both enemy players and NPC ships
    - Often overlaps with bash ships
