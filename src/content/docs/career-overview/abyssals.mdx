## Abyssal Tiers:

Tiers are the categories that show the difficulty. These are the same in other 
aspects of the game when it comes to ai or location difficulties.

T0-T6 is the scale and the difference between them is exponential in difficulty 
so be careful if you decide to go to a higher level. For beginners only T0 and 
maybe T1 are recommended until you have quite a number of runs under your belt.

This chart will explains the naming convention used for them: 

| Tier | Name | Penalty Strength |
|-|-|-|
| 0 | Tranquil | -30% or -50%, random per site | 
| 1 | Calm | -30% or -50%, random per site | 
| 2 | Agitated | -30% or -50%, random per site | 
| 3 | Fierce | -30% or -50%, random per site | 
| 4 | Raging | -50% or -70%, random per site | 
| 5 | Chaotic | -50% or -70%, random per site | 
| 6 | Cataclysmic | -50% or -70%, random per site | 


### Filament Elements 

Each filament has an element that you can read in the info page about what each 
of the different elements do. This can change your fit, so it's recommended 
that you take the time to understand what you're jumping into. 

Each element will give you a buff and a negative as seen by the below chart: 

| Weather | Penalty | Bonus |
|-|-|-|
| Electical | -30/50/70% EM Resist | -50% Capacitor Recharge Time |
| Exotic | -30/50/70% Kinetic Resist | +50% Scan Resolution |
| Firestorm | -30/50/70% Thermal Resist | +50% Armor HP |
| Gamma | -30/50/70% Explosive Resist | +50% Shield HP |
| Dark | -30/50/70% Turret Optimal and Falloff Range | +50% Maximum Velocity |


### Squad Size:

Filaments limit the amount of pilots that can enter Abyssal space at one time:

- 1 filament allows only 1 cruiser
- 2 filaments allows only 1-2 destroyers and no other ship
- 3 filaments allows only 1-3 frigates and no other size ship 

With this format you also can’t bring in different class ships. You must use 
the same class and the size depending on the filaments being used. Plan your 
squads accordingly.

## Limits:

### • Borders

Upon entering Abyssal space you need to be aware of  where the borders are for 
the level you're on. This is important because if you go past these borders 
your ship **RAPIDLY TAKES DAMAGE AND WILL BE DESTROYE**D. 

### • Timer

In Abyssal space there is a timer of **20 minute*s* that you must be done in you 
will **LOSE YOUR SHIP AND ITS CONTENTS**.

### • Structure

Abyssals are set in a 3 level system like stages or floors to a dungeon. You 
need to eliminate all enemies to advance to the next level. Gate activation is 
required to advance to the next level. The difficulty of each level is random 
as to which one is the hardest, medium, and easiest in this space. 

_Note: Coordinate with your Abyssal Lead and make sure that your team jumps 
together from one level to the next. This will ensure that you don’t get blown 
up because you don’t have the support you were expecting from your fellow 
pilots._

## Enemies

Abyssal space can potentially have any NPC enemy ship that is present in the 
game. The majority are Trigvalian, Sleeper, and Drifter ships. 

### Towers

Other than NPC ships, pilots should be wary of the Towers. The massive 
structures that look like a massive tower floating in space should be avoided. 
They will destroy drones if they get within range (between 30-50 km) and 
salvage them.  Make sure that when deploying drones you do so only when you are 
close and pick them up immediately after destroying your target.

## Loot:

The whole reason to do abyssal is the loot, I mean why are you even in there if 
not for the sweet sweet loot. 

### T-0 Loot

At T0 you will receive mostly Filaments,Trigvalian Survey Databases (TSD), 
Crystalline Isogen, and Zero Point Condensate. 

Note:The loot is in big containers (called bio caches) that you need to destroy 
along with all the enemies to advance to the next level of the Abyssal. The 
items that you receive at higher tiers can include blueprints for Trigvalian 
equipment and ships. As other NPC drops, these will only ever be copies not 
originals.

### Crystalline Isogen and Zero Point Condensate

These two items are used as industry crafting materials and can be sold on the 
market or (corp Contract if one listed in the Corp Bulletin), They will often 
vary in price depending on market fluctuations as everything else does. 

### TSD’s

TSD’s are an item that has no use in the game and is only to be sold. However 
if you sell them at any random station, or on any other timeframe than 
Immediate then you will get nothing for them. Due to this you need to go to the 
right NPC station such as a DED logistics station and sell them using the 
Immediate dropdown for 100,000 ISK/TSD.

### Higher Tiers

The blueprints are quite valuable as you can't find them any other way and they 
are used to make very good equipment and ships so make big bucks from it on the 
market or make it yourself.
